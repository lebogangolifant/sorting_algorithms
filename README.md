# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

This repository contains several sorting algorithms implemented in C. Each algorithm is designed to sort an array of integers or a deck of cards in ascending order.

## Tasks

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Task 1 | Bubble Sort - Write a function that sorts an array of integers using the Bubble Sort algorithm. |
| Task 2 | Insertion Sort List - Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers using the Insertion Sort algorithm. |
| Task 3 | Selection Sort - Write a function that sorts an array of integers using the Selection Sort algorithm. |
| Task 4 | Quick Sort - Write a function that sorts an array of integers using the Quick Sort algorithm. |
| Task 5 | Shell Sort - Write a function that sorts an array of integers using the Shell Sort algorithm. |
| Task 6 | Cocktail Shaker Sort - Write a function that sorts an array of integers using the Cocktail Shaker Sort algorithm. |
| Task 7 | Counting Sort - Write a function that sorts an array of integers using the Counting Sort algorithm. |
| Task 8 | Merge Sort - Write a function that sorts an array of integers using the Merge Sort algorithm. |
| Task 9 | Radix Sort (LSD) - Write a function that sorts an array of integers using the Radix Sort algorithm. |
| Task 10 | Bitonic Sort - Write a function that sorts an array of integers using the Bitonic Sort algorithm. |
| Task 11 | Quick Sort (Hoare Partition Scheme) - Write a function that sorts an array of integers using the Quick Sort algorithm with the Hoare partition scheme. |
| Task 12 | Sort Deck of Cards - Write a function that sorts a deck of cards in ascending order. The deck is represented as a doubly linked list. |

## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run any of the sorting algorithms, you can use the `gcc` compiler with the following command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 <main_file.c> <sorting_algorithm.c> <print_array.c> -o <output_name>
